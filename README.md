# Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree
## Behavioral Cloning

### Overview

In this project, a car is trained to drive in a simulated environment by cloning the behavior seen during training mode.


Udacity created a simulator based on the Unity engine that uses real game physics to create a close approximation to real driving.
