# Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree
## Behavioral Cloning

### Overview

In this project, a car is trained to drive in a simulated environment by cloning the behavior seen during training mode.


Udacity created a simulator based on the Unity engine that uses real game physics to create a close approximation to real driving.

<p>Once you’ve downloaded it, extract it and run it.</p>
<p>When you first run the simulator, you’ll see a configuration screen asking what size and graphical quality you would like. We suggest running at the smallest size and the fastest graphical quality. 
We also suggest closing most other applications (especially graphically intensive applications) on your computer, so that your machine can devote its resource to running the simulator.</p>
